        <b><h1>Learn about Charging Stations:</h1></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The era of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has already arrived in India. We have seen major launches in the automobile industry ranging from electric scooters like Ather 450X to electric cars such as the Tata Nexon EV. This has resulted in an increased demand for charging stations across the country. In this article, we will tell you how you can easily locate EV charging stations in India using your phone
    </p>
    <p>
        The crucial factor hindering the faster adoption of electric vehicles is the charging station network which is in a nascent phase in India. However, key players like EESL, Tata Power, Ather, Ola Electric, and others are gradually setting up charging stations for proper infrastructure. Though finding a charging station in the middle of an unfamiliar road can be a task in itself. But there are a few websites and mobile apps that are doing their part to help you in finding an EV charging station near you. 

        Letâ€™s have a glance at the best ways of finding verified EV charging stations nearby.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><h1>Overview</h1></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Electric vehicles (EV) can be charged in a variety
of ways, depending on location and requirement.
Accordingly, charging infrastructure for EVs is of
different types and designed for different applications.
Specifications and standards for EV chargers, also
known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE),
vary from one country to another, based on available
EV models in the market and the characteristics of the
electricity grid.
This chapter explains the technical concepts of electric
vehicle charging infrastructure, and highlights the
need for a contextual approach to local planning and
implementation of EV charging networks.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><h1>Power Rating</h1></b>
    </p>
    <p>
    <p>EVSEs have different power ratings or levels based on
charging requirements, which in turn determine the
input power requirements for charging infrastructure.
Table 2 categorizes EV charging by power level, with
normal power charging going up to 22kW and highpower charging going up to 200kW. While EVSEs with
power ratings up to 500kW are globally available,
they are largely applicable for heavy vehicles like
buses and trucks.</p>
<p>Normal power AC charging is adequate for e-2Ws,
e-3Ws and e-cars. Normal power DC charging is unique
to India, due to the prevalence of LEVs, and the use
of low-voltage batteries in e-cars. Single-phase AC
chargers, with a maximum power rating of 7kW, are
adequate for LEVs and cars with single phase on-board
chargers. Three-phase AC chargers, with a power rating
up to 22kW, are required for e-cars with larger onboard chargers. Input power supply for normal power
charging can be provided from the standard electricity
distribution network.</p>
<p>For high-voltage e-cars with battery capacities
between 30-80kWh, high-power DC charging of 50kW
is used. The power level of DC chargers in the market
ranges between 25kW and 60kW. However higherpowered DC chargers will be available in the near
future. While high-power DC charging takes less time
for e-cars, it requires higher electricity supply with
additional infrastructure. Normal power charging
points are therefore adequate for most charging
requirements, including slow or overnight charging
of e-cars.</p>   
</p>
<p><b><h>PRINCIPLES OF LOCATION PLANNING FOR PUBLIC EV CHARGING</h></b></p>
<p>
<h4>MAXIMIZE ACCESSIBILITY</h4>
<p>Accessibility may be understood as the ease of
finding and getting to public charging facilities from
any location. This includes areas of low estimated
charging demand, which still need a minimum
provision of charging infrastructure. Network planning
and site selection play a role in improving EV charging
accessibility. A greater number of distributed charging
points in an area reduces the average distance EV
users must travel to access public charging. Further,
visibility of charging facilities, ease of entry and egress
at charging sites, and their proximity to major roads
can also influence their accessibility.</p> 
<p><h4>MAXIMIZE UTILIZATION</h4>
    <p>Public charging infrastructure should be located in
        areas with charging demand to ensure high utilization.
        Public charging demand at a given location will
        depend on multiple parameters, including population
        and employment densities, parking availability,
        traffic volumes, presence of points of interest such
        as commercial establishments, transit stations
        or tourist destinations, etc. It also depends on the
        availability of other private or semi-public charging
        facilities in the area.</p>
<p><h4>MINIMIZE COST </h4></p>
<p>The cost of public charging infrastructure primarily
    depends on three factors â€“ the cost of EVSE, cost
    of land, and cost of power supply. All three can be
    significantly reduced by opting for a distributed
    charging network of normal power charging points
    that are less expensive and require less space and
    electricity at any given location. </p>
</p>
<h4>ACCESSIBILITY</h4>
<p>Indicators: Visibility, access from
    major roads and local roads, 24x7 access
    </p>
<p><h4>UTILIZATION</h4></p>
<P>Indicators: Population and employment
    densities, traffic volumes, point of interest,
    transit stations </P>
